# Professional Azure SQL Database Administration
Azure SQL Database is the cloud version of SQL Server. It differs in terms of management, maintenance and administration.  It’s important to know how to administer SQL Database so that you can get the most out of the features that it provides. You will learn different management aspects of an Azure SQL Database, such as migration, backup and restoration, pricing, security, scalability, monitoring and performance optimization, high availability and disaster recovery. You’ll start by understanding the architecture of the Azure SQL Database and its service tiers. Through a narrative of a DBA, who is migrating from a traditional on-premises system to Azure SQL Database, this course will explain the concepts by using different scenarios you might come across while working with Azure SQL Database. If you are interested in developing new or migrating existing applications with Azure SQL Database, then this course is for you.
